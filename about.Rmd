I'm fond of __Data Science__ and an __R(cpp)__ enthusiast.    
I'm the founder and former organizer of [the Grenoble R user group](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).    
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privefl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl) as \@privefl and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-priv%c3%a9) as F. Privé.

### Current work

I am a PhD student (2016 - 2019) in predictive human genetics in [BCM team](http://www-timc.imag.fr/rubrique44.html), Laboratoire TIMC-IMAG, Grenoble, France. I moved to Aarhus, Denmark in May 2019.
My supervisors are [Michael Blum](https://twitter.com/mblum_g) (TIMC-IMAG) and [Hugues Aschard](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/member/hugues-aschard/) (Institut Pasteur).    
My thesis is funded by the [LabEx PERSYVAL-Lab](https://persyval-lab.org/en).

I am currently working on a way to combine summary statistics from GWAS and individual-level genotypes to enhance genomic prediction of human diseases.

I also contribute to R 

- by submitting my own packages to CRAN (or just [GitHub](https://github.com/privefl?tab=repositories)),
- by [contributing to other projects when I can](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Aprivefl+),
- by asking and answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6103040/f-privé),
- by [blogging](https://privefl.github.io/blog/).

### Hometown -- Education

I'm from [Troyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes), France. 
I naturally like Champagne.    
I was in prep school in [Dijon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon).    
Then, I graduated from [ENSIMAG](https://goo.gl/2aDwm1), an engineer school in __Informatics__ and __Applied Mathematics__ in [Grenoble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble). 

I did both my internships in Research:

- the former on goodness-of-fit tests for the Weibull distribution with censored data (through Monte Carlo simulations),
- the latter in predictive human genetics, studying a massive dataset on [Celiac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease).
